# AsterixDB for YCSB
This driver is a binding for the YCSB facilities to operate against a AsterixDB Server cluster. Tested on version 0.9.4.

## Quickstart

### 1. Start a AsterixDB Server
Please see [AsterixDB](https://ci.apache.org/projects/asterixdb/index.html) for more details and instructions.

### 2. Set up YCSB
You need to clone the repository and compile everything.

```
git clone git@github.com:autopear/YCSB.git
cd YCSB
git checkout asterixdb
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

### 3. Create a AsterixDB dataset for testing
Please refer to the example in [create-table-feed.sqlpp](src/main/conf/create-table-feed.sqlpp). Note if you modify the dataverse name, the number of columns, or any parameter for the feed in [db.properties](src/main/conf/db.properties), you must change the SQL++ command accordingly.

### 4. Run the Workload
Before you can actually run the workload, you need to "load" the data first.

```
bin/ycsb load asterixdb -P workloads/workloada -P asterixdb/src/main/conf/db.properties
```

Then, you can run the workload:

```
bin/ycsb run asterixdb -P workloads/workloada -P asterixdb/src/main/conf/db.properties
```

## Configuration Options
Following options can be configurable using `-p`, an example can be found at [db.properties](src/main/conf/db.properties)

* `db.url`: URL for querying AsterixDB's HTTP API. More details can be found at [HTTP API to AsterixDB
](https://ci.apache.org/projects/asterixdb/api.html).
* `db.dataverse`: Name of the dataverse.
* `db.columns`: The number of columns/fields in the dataset, excluding the primary key. The name of each column/field is "fieldX", where X is a number starting from 0.
* `db.batchsize`: The number of records to be batched for INSERT or UPSERT. This option will be disabled if feed is used.
* `db.upsertenabled`: If set to true, UPSERT will be used instead of INSERT. This option will be disabled if feed is used.
* `db.feedenabled`: If set to true, socket feed will be used for insertion. Whether it is an upsert feed or not depending on the creating of the feed.
* `db.feedhost`: Hostname or IP of the socket feed.
* `db.feedport`: Port of the socket feed.
* `db.printcmd`: If set to true, each SQL++ statement will be printed. For a feed insertion, the content of the data package will be printed as a JSON object.
